dotfiles
========

This is my collection of user/application settings ("dotfiles") and personal
scripts. They are mostly adapted to my personal needs, and some scripts may make
[unfortunate assumptions about the environment](#assumptions) (most likely not
considered "standard"). Nevertheless, I try to keep them as clean and non-WTF as
possible, and people are invited to take a look at them, get ideas for their own
dotfiles, and drop comments if something seems odd.

For using the dotfiles, I place them in some location (e.g.
`~/.local/lib/dotfiles`), then symlink each file/directory to their respective
locations.


XDG/FHS
-------

I try to keep the top-level user home directory as clean as possible by
honouring the [XDG base directory
specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/index.html),
adapted to recreate the [Linux file system
hierarchy](http://linux.die.net/man/7/hier) (FHS) under `~/.local`. In detail,
this means that the following environment variables are set:

| Variable          | Location             |
| ----------------- | -------------------- |
| `XDG_CACHE_HOME`  | `~/.local/var/cache` |
| `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` | `~/.local/etc`       |
| `XDG_DATA_HOME`   | `~/.local/var/lib`   |
| `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` | `~/.local/run`       |
| `XDG_LIB_HOME`    | `~/.local/lib`       |
| `XDG_LOG_HOME`    | `~/.local/var/log`   |

> ### Notes
> * `XDG_LIB_HOME` and `XDG_LOG_HOME` are non-standard, but they are
>   nevertheless necessary for representing the FHS locally.
> * `~/.local/run` **must** be a symbolic link to `/run/user/<uid>`.

Furthermore, user-specific applications and scripts are expected to be placed in
`~/.local/bin`.

Unfortunately, some application do not honour the XDG basedir specification, and
setting above variables is often not enough. Various approaches are taken to
achieve the goal:

* For applications using their own environment variables, a simple entry in
  `~/.pam_environment` is usually enough.
* For applications accepting command line arguments, there are local "fake"
  (wrapper) scripts in `.local/bin` that call the real application with the
  right arguments.
* For applications where neither of these apply, I weep (or perhaps resort to
  some ugly LD\_PRELOAD hacks, see issue #7).

See [XDG Base Directory
support](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/XDG_Base_Directory_support) in the
Arch Linux wiki for more details about which applications honour the specs.


Assumptions
-----------

The dotfiles have primarily been used on Arch Linux (and for limited use-cases
on Debian, too, although there are minor issues with tmux and [major issues with
PAM](https://github.com/ayekat/dotfiles/issues/8), both related to Debian
shipping antique versions of software).

* For setting the [XDG basedir variables](#xdgfhs) I use `~/.pam_environment`,
  which is read by [PAM](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/PAM). If other
  authentication frameworks are used, these dotfiles will not work as-is.

* `/usr/sbin`, `/sbin` and `/bin` are generally assumed to have
  [merged](https://www.archlinux.org/news/binaries-move-to-usrbin-requiring-update-intervention/)
  into `/usr/bin`, so all absolute paths to system-widely available software
  point into `/usr/bin` by default (note that this is a more extreme case of the
  [`/usr`
  merge](https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/systemd/TheCaseForTheUsrMerge/)).
  As I strive for compatibility with non-Arch Linux systems, please let me know
  when a path should point somewhere else.

* Lots of configuration files will attempt to run scripts and binaries in
  `~/.local/bin/utils`, provided by the [utils
  repository](https://github.com/ayekat/utils). The missing of latter should be
  non-fatal, though.


Policies
--------

* Application history generally goes into `XDG_DATA_HOME` (see f1147a9 for the
  reasoning). The only things that go into `XDG_LOG_HOME` are "real" logs, i.e.
  data that is no longer read and used by the application itself. The only
  things that go into `XDG_CACHE_HOME` are files that are non-essential and can
  quickly be regenerated by the application, if needed (which is both not the
  case for history files).

* Applications whose configuration is mixed up with other data (or generally not
  supposed to be manually edited) is put into `XDG_DATA_HOME`, reason being that
  I would like to track `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` with git as much as possible. This of
  course only works for applications that allow configuring the location of
  "config" files.

* Shell-agnostic configuration should happen in `XDG_CONFIG_HOME/sh`. This
  allows other, non-zsh shells to work correctly, too, without having to
  duplicate all the shell configuration. The shell-agnostic configuration is
  stored in `environment`, `login` and `config` as well as `profile` and the
  `profile.d` directory for application-specific profile snippets, while only
  shell-specific configuration (prompts, input, history, etc.) should happen in
  zsh's config.

* Although shell aliases are generally more lightweight than wrapper scripts,
  wrapper scripts allow being used also from a non-shell environment (or with
  `sudo`). So it mostly depends on the application whether we create aliases or
  wrapper scripts for them.
